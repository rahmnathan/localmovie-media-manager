[![Build Status](https://jenkins.nathanrahm.com/buildStatus/icon?job=localmovie-media-manager)](https://jenkins.nathanrahm.com/job/localmovie-media-manager/)

This repository is a Spring Boot video streaming service for my media collection.

<h4>Demo</h4>

You can view a brief demo of this project [here](https://nathanrahm.com/projects).

<h4>User Interface</h4>

- [Android Application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rahm.nathan.localmovies&hl=en)
- [ReactJS web application](https://movies.nathanrahm.com) (located in the src/main/js directory).

<h4>APIs</h4>
This service exposes a set of endpoints that facilitate:

- Loading media at a given path ('Movies', 'Series', etc).
- Streaming a media file.
- Loading media events (for persistent Android clients).

<h4>Media Management</h4>
When the service starts, configured directories are recursively scanned to locate media. Based on a naming convention, 
each file/folder is checked against the database. If any metadata is missing, it is downloaded from OMDB and stored. 
The directory naming convention is as follows:

- root-directory/Movies/The Matrix.mp4
- root-directory/Series/The Office/Season 1/S01E01.mp4

When new media is added to a monitored directory, the following process is triggered:

 - Kubernetes job is launched to transcode to H.264/AAC.
 - Media metadata is downloaded from OMDB and stored in database.
 - 'New Media' event is added to database for processing by Android clients.
 - Push notifications are sent to Android devices to notify of new media.
